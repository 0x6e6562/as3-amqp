AS3-AMQP Library Fork
==========================================================================

Fork by: Peter Kieltyka
Original library written by Ben Hood
Original project repository: http://github.com/0x6e6562/as3-amqp

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this fork has is to add an easy-to-use Pub-Sub client
pattern into the as3-amqp library.


Interfaces:
-----------
org.amqp.patterns.PublishClient
org.amqp.patterns.SubscribeClient


Classes:
--------
org.amqp.patterns.impl.PublishClientImpl
org.amqp.patterns.impl.SubscribeClientImpl


Changes: 
--------

1. PublishClientImpl 
- Publishes messages to a topic based on the key provided.

2. SubscribeClientImpl 
- Subscribes to one or more topics and creates a listener for 
consuming messages to a callback function.

3. PublishSubscribeClientTest 
- Test suite that demonstrates the functionality of 
PublishClientImpl and SubscribeClientImpl


TODO / Further exploration: 
---------------------------

- Optimize the file size of overall library to decrease its 304kb 
weight down to something reasonable. For one, I noticed the core 
library depends on flexunit.swc, which weighs in at 400kb itself. 
Perhaps looking at removing that dependency will cut some fat, in 
particular the ArrayList class is used and should be substituted with 
something already available.
- Consider ignoring all messages that are sent from the same application
to a subscribed topic (BasicProperties, userid argument might work)
- Remove binding for a specific routing key when unsubscribing
- Wildcard topics still require some testing

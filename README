AS3-AMQP Library
==========================================================================


This library provides a high level and a low level AMQP interface for AS3.

High Level Interfaces:
----------------------
org.amqp.patterns.PublishClient
org.amqp.patterns.SubscribeClient
org.amqp.patterns.RpcClient
org.amqp.patterns.RpcServer

TODO / Further exploration:
---------------------------

- Optimize the file size of overall library to decrease its 304kb
weight down to something reasonable. For one, I noticed the core
library depends on flexunit.swc, which weighs in at 400kb itself.
Perhaps looking at removing that dependency will cut some fat, in
particular the ArrayList class is used and should be substituted with
something already available.
|--> Update: the dependency is now removed - the build script just needs modification

- Remove the dependency on ericfeminella's HashMap

- Make the TLS bundling optional

- Add the Flexunit Test Suite to the build.xml so that it can be run from
the command line

- Consider ignoring all messages that are sent from the same application

to a subscribed topic (BasicProperties, userid argument might work)

- Remove binding for a specific routing key when unsubscribing

- Wildcard topics still require some testing

Known Issues:
-------------

- The code generator should produce logging code that can dump the contents of each method
